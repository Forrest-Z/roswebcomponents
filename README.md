# roswebcomponents
A JavaScript library for rapid development of ROS connected web interfaces

This library provides [custom HTML UI components]() which interface with JavaScript functions to abstract [roslibjs](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/roslibjs), simplifying publishing and subscribing to topics down to making a one-line JS function call, or simply writing a HTML tag, for a set of common robot behaviours and data sources. The functions are split into two categories:
1. [Action functions](/docs/action-functions.md), which trigger robot behaviours.
2. [Listener functions](/docs/listener-functions.md), which return data from the robot.
